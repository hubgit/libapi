The United States has [(ε ∼ 5,000 M−1 cm−1) to the cysteine S π to Cu(ii)] awarded a US$90-million contract to biotech company MedImmune to produce a new live attenuated virus vaccine against influenza A (H1N1) swine flu. The 1 June announcement follows the placing of almost $1 billion in vaccine-supply contracts to pharmaceutical companies a fortnight ago.

Nature News analyses the likely impact of these efforts on domestic and world ability to mobilize sufficient swine flu vaccine - and the importance of deploying new technologies to boost production capacity.
Why the rash of announcements from the United States now?

"Someone has gotten the message, someone is listening," says Robert Webster, a flu virologist at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Webster, who developed some of the first subunit antigen flu vaccines, says these lost the "marvellous adjuvant effect of whole virus vaccines; it's absolutely the case that we need these new adjuvants to give that same effect."
Are there any other new technologies for increasing our vaccine stores?

The picture here isn't bright. The WHO is trying to negotiate for 10% of global production to be set aside for developing countries. If, for example, 860 million doses are available by Christmas, that would mean just 86 million doses; if two doses were needed per person, it will be only enough for 43 million people. That's "a drop in the bucket," Fedson says. But if there is aggressive political leadership to focus on maximizing output by diverting production capacity to a mix of adjuvants, live attenuated virus and maybe caterpillar-cell vaccines, there is just the possibility of having more than enough vaccine to go round. That remains a remote hope.
